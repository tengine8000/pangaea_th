## üíº &nbsp; About Pangaea_TH Project


This project is an implementation of an HTTP-based notification system. A server (or set of servers) will keep track of ```topics -> subscribers``` where a topic is a string and a subscriber is an HTTP endpoint.

When a message is published on a topic, it should be forwarded to all subscriber endpoints.

### ‚öôÔ∏è &nbsp; Running and Testing

To get this project up and running, you need a minimum of 2 instances running on different ports and on different terminals.

The first terminal will be for the main ```Publishing server``` or **Publisher** and the second terminal will be the ```Subscribing server``` or **Subscriber**.

For this example run, we will use ```PORT 8000``` for the **Publisher** and ```PORT 9000``` for the **Subscriber**. If those ports are in use by your system, you can choose any ports above ```1024```.

#### **Steps**

- On the **Publisher**, run ```php artisan serve --port=8000``` to start it.
- On the **Subscriber**, run ```php artisan serve --port=9000``` to start it.
- To make API calls, you can use ```curl```, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or [REST Client plugin](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) if you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="20px" />

##### **Using Curl**
- ```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "url": "http://localhost:9000/test1"}' http://localhost:8000/subscribe/topic1 ```

- ```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "url": "http://localhost:9000/test2"}' http://localhost:8000/subscribe/topic1```

- ```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "hello"}' http://localhost:8000/publish/topic1```

##### **Using REST Client plugin**

This is a lot easier and more fun.

Go to the ```test.http``` file at the root of the project, and if you have the plugin installed, you will see the ```Send Request``` links above each of the sample request I created in the file for tests.

You can edit and click each of the requests to see the responses in the **Subscriber** terminal(s).
